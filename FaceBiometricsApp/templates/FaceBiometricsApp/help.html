                       <p style="color:#000">First and for most, it is better to look at a recap scenario to understand what face recognition is. When you look at your friend walking down the street or a picture of him/her, you recognize that s/he is your friend somebody else. Excitingly, when you look at your friend or a picture of him/her, you look at his/her face first before looking at anything else. Ever questioned why you do that and nobody asks you how you do that. This is a natural and daily activity when you meet somebody else. Fine, this is you doing face recognition. <a href="help">Need Help?</a></p>
                       <p >How does face recognition works? It is moderately simple and intuitive. Take a real life scenario.  When you meet somebody first time in your life, you don't recognize him, yes? While he talks or greetings with you, you look at his face, eyes, nose, mouth, color, and overall look. This is how your mind learning or training for the face recognition of that person by gathering face data using his own features called Haar-like features (Viola and Jones, 2001) in machine learning. Then assume he tells you that his name is Mulatu. At this point, your mind knows that the face data it just learned belongs to Mulatu. Now, your mind is trained and ready to do face recognition on Mulatu's face. Next time, when you will see Mulatu or his face in a picture or video stream, you will immediately recognize him. This is how face recognition work. The more you will meet Mulatu, the more data your mind will collect about Mulatu and especially his face and the better you will become at recognizing him. 
In this scenario, you recognize Mulatu since it is natural. Now the question is how to recognize persons with a machine learning. The recognition steps for face recognition in machine learning are the same as we discussed it in real life scenario above.
   Data Gathering: Gather face data (face images) of the person’s you want to recognize
   Training the Recognizer: Feed that face data and respective names of each face to the face recognizer so that it can learn.
   Recognition: Feed new faces of the persons and see if the face recognizer you just trained recognizes them.
Here, the question is how to achieve all these data gatherings (feature extraction), training of the recognizer (classification and grouping), and recognition. Here we go to answer these question in the following sections.
2.6.1.   Feature extraction 
In the above scenario, we have seen how your mind gathers Mulatu’s eyes, nose, mouth, and face called features as indicated in Figure 2.2 in which Viola and Jones features are mapped into grouped features in terms of eyes, nose and mouth.





 
These features are Haar-like features (Viola and Jones, 2001) used to train the machine. In machine learning using OpenCV, we can extract these features by using principal component analysis techniques. PCA is the most powerful and the first choice in terms of its speed in computing time, accuracy, and performance (Kaur and Himansh, 2015;Kim, 2002).
According (Faruqe and Hasan, 2009), currently, there is no technique that provides a robust solution in all situations and in different applications in wich face recognition encounters. The authors indicate that whatever the case is the performance of the face recognition system is a dominant factor and this performance can be determined by the computing time to extract features and classifying them into groups for feature extractor. Beside this, the author proposed PCA for feature extraction technique and SVM for classification and recgontion.
Furthermore, to overcome face recognition challenges, PCA is absolutely the simplest technique to implement and has extremely fast computation time to extract the absolute most important and relevant information within a given face and similarly, it tries to design a model that best describes it (Kaur and Himansh, 2015 ). The authors also said PCA is a standard technique for face recognition by reducing dimensions of a given face, preserving only the absolute most important information of the face, and reducing noise.
Similarly, PCA can help to reduce the dimensionality of the data components by taking the given face (Bhardwaj and Gupta, 2015) in which eigenfaces obtained from by using a covariance matrix of the trained dataset. 
According to (Kaur and Himansh, 2015; Kim, 2002; Riddhi P. and Shruti B., 2013; Kim, 2002; Faruqe and Hasan, 2009), face contains a set of features and can be extracted using PCA if the performance of the face recognition is in questionable.
